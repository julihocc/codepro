# Working with numbers

Let’s take our first steps toward using Python to explore the world of math and
science. We’ll keep it simple now so you can  get a handle on using Python itself. We’ll start
by performing basic mathematical operations, and then we’ll write simple programs for manipulating
and understanding numbers. Let’s get started!
