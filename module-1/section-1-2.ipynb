When we ask Python to evaluate the result of the expression a + 1, it sees that the number that a refers to is 3, and then it adds 1 and displays the output (4). At ➋, we change the value of a to 5, and this is reflected in the second addition operation. Using the name a is convenient because you can simply change the number that a points to and Python uses this new value when a is referred to anywhere after  that.\n",
    "This kind of name is called a label. You may have been introduced to the term variable to describe the same idea elsewhere. However, considering that variable is also a mathematical term (used to refer to something like x in the equation x + 2 = 3), in this book I use the term variable only in the context of mathematical equations and expressions. I use the term label to refer to the name that you assign to a number or other object in Python."

    "## Different Kinds of Numbers\n",
    "You may have noticed that I’ve used two kinds of numbers to demonstrate the mathematical operations—numbers without a decimal point, which you already know as integers, and numbers with a decimal point, which programmers call floating point numbers. We humans have no trouble recognizing and working with numbers whether they’re written as integers, floating point decimals, fractions, or roman numerals. But in some of the programs that we write in this book, it will only make sense to perform a task on a particular type of number, so we’ll often have to write a bit of code to have the programs check whether the numbers we input are of the right type.\n",
    "Python considers integers and floating point numbers to be different types. If you use the function type(), Python will tell you what kind of number you’ve just input. For example:"

As we just saw, Python won’t recognize a number like 1.0 or 4.0 as an integer, so if we want to accept numbers like that as valid input in these programs, we’ll have to convert them from floating point numbers to integers. Luckily, there’s a function built in to Python that will do this for us. It’s called int(), and it takes a floating point number as an argument and returns an integer. For example:"
